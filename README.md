# Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana for Go, Py, and Java

You will find demos that shows hwo to use Prometheus to monitor your service in your favortie language. 

My recommendation is to start with monitoring before investing in the centralized logging ([demo of EFK-stack](https://github.com/wojciech12/talk_observability_logging)) and introducing tracing.

Demos:

- [Go](demo_go) and [slides](slides_go/index.pdf)([html](slides_go/)),
- [Python](demo_py/),
- [Java](demo_java/).
